# physim
**physim** is a c++ header-only namespace for computational physics.
The goal of this project is to offer the user the opportunity to do his physics' things without having too much trouble with the c++ language and syntax. 
The other main goal is to give physical meaning to all the things that are declared hereby.

# How to install it?
Download the header file [physim.hpp](https://github.com/lorenzoliuzzo/physim/blob/e0432f73e1ba4ade984c00e8e4b08537f8b42e27/physim.hpp) and include it in your .cpp as 
``` c++
#include "physim.hpp"
```

# What actually does physim?
There are few math things that provides you the very basic tools: 
* some usefull contants
* operations and algebra
* descriptive statistics
* functions
* integrals
* pseudo-randomic number generator
* ODEs solver

And there are some physics stuff that allows you to use:
* some usefull contants
* units of the SI and derived
* measurements and uncertaint measurements
* position and velocity in a 3D system
* objects (material point, mass, charge, particle, oscillators, etc.) 
* keeping track of the inexorable passage of time with a timer.
